# Park CSUSM
Live Parking Data for **California State University San Marcos**.

> Supplemental product to minimum viable product of one of the Capstone Projects of Fall 2023 implemented natively in SwiftUI.

## Building
A valid [StreetsOnCloud](http://streetsoncloud.com) API Key is required to run
successfully.
This key (`API_KEY`) must be obtained from the
[Parking and Commuter Services](https://www.csusm.edu/parking/) department and
placed in a `.xcconfig` file within the project.

## TODO
* Implement `WidgetKit`
* Provide detailed parking data on a per-level basis.
